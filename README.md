👋 Hey there! I'm a software engineer with a penchant for Python 🐍, Go 🏎️, and C++ ⚔️—because who doesn't love a good challenge? I'm passionate about IoT, where everyday objects become just a bit smarter (like me after my morning coffee ☕), and I'm always on the hunt for cutting-edge solutions. I believe in the power of open-source, and I've contributed to a few projects that hopefully don't break the internet. When I'm not coding, you might find me debugging the Wi-Fi in my smart fridge or figuring out how to automate my coffee maker.

Join me on this wild ride of bytes, bugs, and brilliant ideas! 🚀
