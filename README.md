# Goldenhand76
üëã Hey there! I'm a software engineer with a penchant for Python üêç, Go üèéÔ∏è, and C++ ‚öîÔ∏è‚Äîbecause who doesn't love a good challenge? I'm passionate about IoT, where everyday objects become just a bit smarter (like me after my morning coffee ‚òï), and I'm always on the hunt for cutting-edge solutions. I believe in the power of open-source, and I've contributed to a few projects that hopefully don't break the internet. When I'm not coding, you might find me debugging the Wi-Fi in my smart fridge or figuring out how to automate my coffee maker.

Join me on this wild ride of bytes, bugs, and brilliant ideas! üöÄ

*Here is the most recent projects that I've done :*

## Project: [APADANA](https://github.com/goldenhand76/APADANA)
### Description: 
Developed a comprehensive system using Django to handle incoming data from devices, real-time monitoring, and notifications, incorporating various architectural patterns and technologies.

### Key Responsibilities:

- Architected and implemented a layered, component-based system:
- - Client-Server Model: Managed server-client interactions using Django to handle requests and responses.
- - Component-Based Design: Developed and integrated modular components, including authentication, monitoring, control, and notification modules.
- - Monolithic Architecture: Combined all components into a single, cohesive Django application, ensuring streamlined interaction and performance.
- Event-Driven and Real-Time Processing:
- - Utilized Django Channels to implement real-time data monitoring and updates.
- - Employed Celery for asynchronous task management, ensuring timely execution of control actions and background processes.
- Database Management:
- - Designed and maintained two distinct databases for accounting and time-series data, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.
- - Stream-Based Data Handling: Implemented systems to process and analyze continuous streams of time-series data in real-time.

### Technologies Used:

- Frameworks: Django, Django Channels, Celery
- Databases: PostgreSQL (or relevant database technologies)
- Architectural Styles: Client-Server, Layered, Component-Based, Monolithic, Event-Driven, Stream-Based
- APIs: Developed RESTful APIs for various modules, including authentication, monitoring, and notifications.
